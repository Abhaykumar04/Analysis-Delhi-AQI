# Analysis-Delhi-AQI

##### Air pollution has been a major issue in Delhi for several years. With the increase in population and industrialization, the air quality has been deteriorating steadily. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown in 2020, there was a noticeable change in the air quality of Delhi. In this article, we will explore the effect of the lockdown on pollution in Delhi by analyzing air quality data from 2019 and 2020.

##### The data used for this analysis was obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which is the national agency responsible for monitoring air quality in India. The dataset includes hourly measurements of various air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2, recorded at different monitoring stations across Delhi.

##### To analyze the data, we used Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and visualization. We imported the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and cleaned the data by removing any missing values and outliers.

##### We then visualized the data using various plotting libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. We compared the air quality data from 2019 and 2020 using line plots, and observed a significant improvement in air quality during the lockdown period in 2020.

### In conclusion

##### The analysis of air quality data from Delhi clearly indicates a significant improvement in air quality during the lockdown period in 2020. This suggests that reducing vehicular traffic and industrial activities can have a positive impact on air quality. This study highlights the importance of continued efforts to reduce pollution in Delhi, and the need for sustainable and long-term solutions to address this pressing issue.
